Hi there! I'm Avinash.

I'm a Site reliability engineer by profession and I enjoy tinkering around with Technology. And I also have a myriad of interests. Usually, in phases, I get obsessed with certain topics and I end up doing in-depth research about them. And it can be about a variety of topics like technology, personal finance, productivity, health, etc.

What I'm working on now: I have set up a Home lab and have been exploring more in that area.

For my professional credentials , please refer to my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinashdharan/).
