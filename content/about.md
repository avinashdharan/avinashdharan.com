Hi there! I'm Avinash.

I'm a Site reliability engineer by profession and I enjoy tinkering around with
Technology. And I also have a myriad of interests. Usually in phases, I get obsessed about certain topics and I end up doing indepth research about it. And it can touch a lot of topics like technology, personal finance, health, etc. 

Right now, I have set up a Home lab and have been exploring a lot in that area. 

For my professional credentials , please refer to my [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avinashdharan/).
