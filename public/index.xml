      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi there! I&rsquo;m Avinash.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Site reliability engineer by profession and I enjoy tinkering around with Technology. And I also have a myriad of interests. Usually, in phases, I get obsessed with certain topics and I end up doing in-depth research about them. And it can be about a variety of topics like technology, personal finance, productivity, health, etc.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m working on now: I have set up a Home lab and have been exploring more in that area.</p>
